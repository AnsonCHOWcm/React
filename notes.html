        <h2>Using React-DOM to edit html</h2>
        <p>Syntax : ReactDOM.render(HTML CODE, POSITION (Selected by Document etc))</p>
        <p>Note that one powerful features of React : we can create a function that retuen some HTML DOM
            <br>
            we can call in by tag its name under HTML CODE of the render
            <br>
            ***The function shd be start with capital letter
        </p>
        <p>We can also make the DOM as a variable (JSX make it as JS Object) and recall it under HTML CODE</p>
